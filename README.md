# Retail-Price-Optimization with different Multiple Regression Models, ExtraTree, GB, XGB, CatBoost, and LGBM. 

A simple and explanatory repository for predicting retail prices using Different Regression Models.

## Introduction

This repository addresses multiple regression problems: predicting retail prices. We employ the Multiple Regression algorithms, ExtraTree, GB, XGB, CatBoost, and LGBM to build a predictive model. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the steps taken to accomplish them.

## Project Overview

To tackle this regression problem, we follow a structured approach:

1. **Understanding the Data:** The first step is to gain a deep understanding of the dataset. We examine its features, identify potential challenges, and formulate strategies to preprocess and analyze the data effectively.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data is crucial to understanding its behavior and shape. We create graphical charts to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and to identify patterns in the data.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** We preprocess the data to prepare it for model building. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data into numerical form, and performing feature scaling or selection as needed.

4. **Model Building:** We utilize the Scikit-learn library to construct Multiple Regression models. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and fine-tuning it for optimal performance.

5. **Validation and Evaluation:** We assess the model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared. Cross-validation is employed to ensure the model's robustness.

6. **Ongoing Improvement:** The project is a work in progress, and we continuously explore ways to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.
